## Inferential statistics applied to a Stroop Effect measurement

This analysis aims to compute descriptive statistics and to perform a statistical test on a dataset based on a psychological phenomenon: the Stroop Effect. It was coded as a Jupyter Notebook in Python and is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.  

[The notebook can be viewed here](https://github.com/tbnsilveira/DAND-inferentialStatistics/blob/master/tbnsilveira_Project04_TestPerceptualPhenomenon.ipynb) rendered as a static HTML file or at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tsilveira/inferential-statistics-and-hypothesis-testing), where a full featured visualization is provided.
